 # PyQt_GUIs
Recently I started to learn to create GUIs through PyQt5 Module in Python.
I have two projects in mind that I want to develop; they are kind of similar because 
their main purpose is to be an interface to populate a database. I think that by creating them
would be easier to carry out this a little boring task.

I found a very useful and pedagogical book that helps you learn PyQt by a bunch of examples. Here it is the link ...

I may use branches to develop each of these projects. I hope this makes sense to whom may read this repository.


## Project 1. Inventory of Seeds (Branch...)
Due to Pandemics...


## Project 2. Inventory of Electronic Stuff (Branch..)
